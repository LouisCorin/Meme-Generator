My first Interactive React App.
The project was built from scratch on Scrimba.com

Building a Meme-Generator, I learned a lot of things and touched on a good amount of topics.


Event listeners, One of the key components of an interactive web app, is the ability to listen to events.
State is a crucial topic I learned that allows us to build apps that store dynamic data.
Conditional rendering was necessary, allowing us to create distinct components that encapsulate the behavior we need.
Forms & side effects and how to handle side effects in our React code were the last steps in the journey so far. 
These topics next to the previous 2 sections make up a robust introduction to the React library.
